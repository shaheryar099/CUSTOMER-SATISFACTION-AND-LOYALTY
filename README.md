📊 Using Power BI, I explored:
✔️ Top factors driving high vs. low satisfaction
✔️ Loyalty trends across age, gender, and purchase groups
✔️ Regional satisfaction clusters using location data
✔️ Impact of customer support on overall experience
✔️ How satisfaction factors like Price and Product Variety affect loyalty

🔎 My analysis was based on real-world business questions like:

"Do repeat buyers show higher satisfaction?"
"Are certain customer groups more loyal than others?"
"Which cities are our happiest — and least happy — customers located in?"
